__Have questions? These are the most Frequently Asked Questions about Hacktoberfest.__

## General
### What is Hacktoberfest?
Hacktoberfest is a month-long celebration of open source software run by DigitalOcean in partnership with GitHub and Twilio.

* Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community!
* Five quality pull requests must be submitted to public GitHub repositories.
* You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31.

### How do I get started?
Register at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ Submit a PR to any public GitHub repository. Quality contributions are encouraged! You can look for open issues labeled "Hacktoberfest" for inspiration.

Maintaining a repo?

Create issues labeled or label existing ones “Hacktoberfest” on your GitHub projects to help new contributors know what to work on. Tag any spam or irrelevant PRs with the "invalid" label to disqualify them.

### How do I track my progress?
Log in with your GitHub account at https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/ to check your progress and stats.

### I completed 5 PRs. When will I receive my t-shirt?
We will start sending out emails with more details on redeeming t-shirts throughout the month. Stay tuned!

### How do I get stickers?
Stickers are included with your t-shirt, once you complete 5 PRs.

### What happens if I complete fewer than 5 PRs by the end of the month?
Unfortunately you will have to submit at least 5 PRs in order to get a T-shirt.

## Rules
### Do contributions made outside of GitHub count?
No, PRs must be made on the GitHub platform.

### Do issues/commits count?
No, only PRs count.

### I signed up for Hacktoberfest mid-October. Will PRs that I created earlier in October count?
Yes, all pull requests created between Oct 1 and Oct 31 will count, regardless of when you register for Hacktoberfest. Pull requests created before Oct 1 but merged after do not count.

### Do issues have to be tagged #Hacktoberfest to count?
No, any pull request made on a public repository counts, whether it's attached to a #Hacktoberfest issue or not.

### Do PRs made on my own repos count?
Yes, but we strongly encourage you to make quality contributions to other repositories.

### Can I make PRs to issues/repos that are not listed on the homepage?
Yes, as long as the repository is approved.

### Do multiple PRs to the same repo count?
Yes, every one of them will count separately.

### Do PRs have to be accepted/merged?
No. They will still count unless they are spam, irrelevant, or tagged as invalid.

## Shipping
### Will I have to pay anything to receive my t-shirt/stickers?
T-shirts are free of charge for participants. We are covering shipping costs as well.

### I didn't receive my Hacktoberfest 2017 T-shirt/Swag!
We are no longer printing 2017 T-shirts. If you did not receive your T-shirt, this means we tried multiple times and they did not make it. We are working hard on improving the shipping process this year so that everyone receives their T-shirts. Thank you for your understanding.

### Will I have to pay anything/custom tax/duty for the t-shirt?
We write down a $ value on the mailed packages low enough that we don't expect any issues with custom tax, but we cannot guarantee that—you might have to pay a small fee depending on your country's import policies.

### When will my t-shirt be shipped? (Intl)
You will receive an email once your t-shirt is shipped. It can take up to 3-5 weeks after shipment for international orders to be delivered.

### When will my t-shirt be shipped? (US)
You will receive an email once your t-shirt is shipped. It can take up to 1-2 weeks after shipment for orders within the U.S. to be delivered.

### How do I return or exchange an item?
If you believe your order was mis-shipped, contact us with the order # in the subject line and an explanation of the incorrect item you received. Otherwise, within 30 days of original purchase, follow the instructions at https://kotisdesign.com/returns. You will be responsible for shipping the item back to us.

### My international order is delayed. What can I do?
